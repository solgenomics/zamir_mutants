		<u>EMS mutagenesis protocol (tomato seeds)</u><BR>
		<BR>
		Imbide seeds on wet Whatman paper (8-10 hrs)<BR>
		Transfer seeds to an Erlenmeyer bottle containing dH2O (100ml for 10,000 seeds)<BR>
		Add 0.5% EMS solution<BR>
		Mix and incubate for 12 hrs with gentle shaking in hood at room temperature<BR>
		Remove the EMS (put EMS solution into 1M NaOH overnight,<BR>
		then dispose as regular waste.<BR>
		Also wash all dishes and pipettes with NaOH)<BR>
		Rinse the seeds extensively under running water for 5-10 minutes<BR>
		Dry the seeds in incubator<BR>
		Sow the seeds, preferably on the same day<BR>
		<BR><BR>
		Calibration of EMS concentration: (all treatments were given for 12hours)<BR>
		<blockquote>
			0.5% EMS = LD15<BR>
			0.7% = LD25<BR>
			0.9% = LD70<BR>
			1%= LD90<BR>
