	<TD><h1>How to search the database</h1>
		<br>
		<FONT size=+1>
		<LI>Click on <A HREF="/cgi-bin/mutation_site/mutant04_search.cgi">Search the database</A> 				
		link
		<br></LI>
		<h3>There are three options for search:</h3>
		<OL>
		<LI><B>search according to family ID:</B><BR>
		If you know the family ID of a specific mutant line, write in the text box the family code.
		<br>
		Each mutant line code begins with "e" for <A HREF="protocol.html#EMS">
		EMS mutants</A> or "n" for <A HREF="protocol.html#fn">FN mutants</A>
		<br>followed by a 4 digit number.<BR>
		So if you are interested in family no. 2 from the EMS mutants the family code will be 		
		e0002<BR><BR></LI>
		<LI><B>Search according to a keyword:</B><BR>
		type in the keyword that fits the mutant you are interested in.<BR>
		(example keywords: wiry, dwarf, anantha, ghost, entire)<BR><BR>
		</LI>
		<LI><B>Search according to the phenotypic catalog:</B><br>
		In the phenotypic catalog there are 15 categories<br>
		For each category there are several sub-categories that appear on the adjacent pull-down 		
		menu.<br>
		A mutant can belong only to one sub-category in each of the 15 categories<br>
		<br>
		You must select at least one category. Selecting sub-category is optional.<br>
		<br>
		When selecting more than one category the search will be for mutants classified to all the<br>
		categories selected (category1 <B>and</B> category2).<br>
		Therefor, when selecting many categories the output will be very few mutants or none.<br>
		<br>
		It's recommended to search first for one category and then narrowing down the results<br>
		by selecting one sub-category and/or adding another category.<br>
		<br>
		</LI>
		</OL>

		<A NAME="results"><h2>Search results:</h2></A>
		<B>For each mutant in the search results its "ID card" is printed:</B><br><br>
		<LI><B>Code:</B> a unique code for each mutant in the database ("e0002m1)- begins with "e" for 		
		<A HREF="protocol.html#EMS">EMS</A>
		or "n" for <A HREF="protocol.html#fn">fast-neutron</A> mutant, followed by 4-digit number 
		which is the number of the <A HREF="family.html">mutant line</A>.
		The last two characters are "m" + a number which stands for the mutation number within the 
		line. Since each line can segregate for more than one mutation, their codes will be similar 
		except for the last digit. </LI>
		<LI><B>Details:</B> description of the mutant</LI>
		<LI><B>Verified:</B> whether the mutant phenotype was verified in the M3 generation ("yes" or 
		"no")</LI>
		<LI><B>Gene:</B> mode of action of the mutated gene ("recessive, dominant, 
		partial-dominance"). This field does not appear for all mutants.</LI>
		<LI><B>Similar to:</B> A link to the <A HREF="http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu">TGRC</A> database. 	
		Appears for mutants that show phenotypic similarity to known genes from the TGRC 		
		collection</LI>
		<LI><B>Categories:</B> a list all the categories from the <A 
		HREF="screen.html#catalog">phenotypic catalog</A> that the mutant is classified into</LI>
		<br><br>
		The description of the mutant is followd by its photo thumbnails (if it has any). Clicking 		
		each thumbnail opens a large photo in another window.
