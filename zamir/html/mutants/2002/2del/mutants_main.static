    <li>The C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center (TGRC) is a genebank of wild relatives, monogenic mutants and miscellaneous genetic stocks of tomato. The wild species group includes representatives of all nine Lycopersicon species, as well as 4 related Solanum species. The monogenic mutants include spontaneous and induced mutations affecting many aspects of plant development, introgressed disease resistance genes, and protein marker stocks.

  <ul>
    <li>"The Genes That Make Tomatoes." This database is hosted by SGN in collaboration with the Zamir Lab at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
All data was collected from a mutagenesis project, in which over 
100,000 m2 plants were screened in the field for mutant phenotypes 
at defined developmental stages (summer 2001 and 2002). 
In the web site there is a description of the project and the mutant 
population as well as a new search engine. The collection of 3000 
monogenic mutants is amenable for searching 
according to a detailed phenotypic catalog and combinations of traits.
