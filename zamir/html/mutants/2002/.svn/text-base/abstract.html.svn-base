Mutants offer the most direct way to associate a gene and its phenotype.<BR>
We are developing a <a href= "protocols/seeds.html">germplasm resource</a> and a <a href= "protocols/screen.html#catalog">
phenotypic catalog</a> of <a href= "protocols/mutagen/ems.html">EMS</a> and
<a href= "protocols/mutagen/fn.html">fast neutron</a> mutants<BR>
in the genetic background of the variety <a href= "population/m82.html">M82</a>.

M2 generation seed were collected from single M1 plants, for constructing
a <A HREF="population/family.html">family design,<br>
</A> and in a <A HREF="population/bulk.html">bulk,</A> for keeping a mutant seed stock available for large scale screening.<BR>
In the summers of 2001 and 2002 about 5000 M2 generation EMS families  and 4000 Fast-neutron families
(12 plants each) were planted in a commercial field and <A HREF="protocols/screen.html">screened</A> for phenotypic mutations.<BR>
Each mutant was characterized according to a <a href ="protocols/screen.html#catalog">phenotypic catalog</a>.<BR>
<BR><br>
The collection of 3000 monogenic mutants is amenable for
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/mutation_site/mutant02_search.cgi">searching</A>
according to a detailed phenotypic catalog and combinations of traits.<br>
Click <a href= "help.html">here </a>for help on using the mutant search engine.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in obtaining seed please <a href="MAILTO:shaham@agri.huji.ac.il?SUBJECT=mutants">
email</a> a list of mutant codes
