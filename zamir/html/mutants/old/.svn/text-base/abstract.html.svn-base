Functional genomics is considered as one of the major challenges of the post genomic era,<BR> 
during which databases will provide sequences for most, if not all the 20-40,000 plant genes.<BR> 
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) of a high proportion of these genes are already available<BR> 
in sequence databases, for Arabidopsis and maize.<BR><BR>
Nevertheless, the function of only few hundred plant genes has been clearly demonstrated.<BR>
Mutants offer the most direct way to associate a gene and its function.<BR><BR>
Years of tomato genetics and breeding facilitated the isolation of approximately 500<BR> 
monogenic mutations in a variety of genetic backgrounds. Currently missing from the tomato<BR> 
genomic picture is a large collection of monogenic mutations in a uniform genetic background<BR> 
that would allow applying the developing genomic technologies for the isolation of gene<BR> 
sequences responsible for the phenotypes.<BR><BR>

The objective of this research is to generate a large number of single gene mutations in the<BR> 
genetic background of the processing tomato variety <A HREF="population/m82.html">M82</A>.<BR> 
The seeds were treated with two mutagens:<BR><A HREF="protocols/mutagen/fn.html">Fast neutron</A> 
source that causes deletions of a few kilo bases<BR>  
and ethyl methane sulphonate <A HREF="protocols/mutagen/ems.html">(EMS)</A> that causes point mutations by inserting or deleting of a single<BR>
nucleotide (SNP).<BR>
The M1 generation seeds were sown, M2 seeds were collected from single plants, for constructing<BR>
a <A HREF="population/family.html">family design,</A> and in a <A HREF="population/bulk.html">bulk,</A> 
for keeping a mutant seed stock available for large scale screening.<BR>
In the summer of 2001 about 2000 M2 generation EMS families  and 3500 Fast-neutron families<BR> 
(12 plants each) were planted in a commercial field and <A HREF="protocols/screen.html">screened</A> for phenotypic mutations.<BR>
Each mutant was characterized and assigned into a phenotypic group.<BR> 
Click <A HREF="protocols/screen.html#catalog">here</A> for the phenotypic catalog.<BR>
Seed collection was performed according to the nature of the mutation/s in each family.<BR>
Click <A HREF="protocols/seeds.html">here</A> to see how seeds were collected from families segregating for a mutation.<BR>
<BR>
In total we've isolated about 1000 EMS  and 500 fast-neutron mutants in the background of M82.<BR>
You can see photos of represntative mutants in each of the phenotypic categories.<BR>
