		From single lines that segregate for a mutant phenotype seeds are<BR>
		extracted separately from two mutant plants.
		<BR>
		From lines that show segregation for two mutations (where there are<BR> 
		2 independent plants for each of the mutations) seeds are extracted <BR>
		from 2 plants for each phenotype (total 4)
		<BR>
		From single mutant lines where there is a single plant showing a mutant<BR> 
		phenotype seeds are extracted from it and from a bulk of the normal sibs.
		<BR>
		From single lines that segregate for sterility seeds are extracted from<BR> 
		the bulk (1 fruit per plant).
		<BR>
		From lines with more than 2 mutations seed will be extracted individually <BR>
		from all plants.

		<HR>
		Bulk seed from M2 families where extracted individualy from 5000 EMS lines.<BR>
		This is one quarter of the load:
