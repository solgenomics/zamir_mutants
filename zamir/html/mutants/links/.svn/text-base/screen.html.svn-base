		Phenotyping is the rate-limiting step in such large-scale mutagenesis studies.
		Our approach is to develop a stepwise protocol for extensive phenotypic analysis
		aimed at capturing data and images describing the entire life cycle of the plants.
		The first phenotypic screen is conducted in M2 generation and is based on visual
		characterization of the plants at all developmental stages from the nursery until
		fruit maturation in the field.<BR>
		It should be noted that this screen in family structure allows to isolate not only
		variation of major effects but also minor 'QTL like' mutations.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		Verification of a monogenic mutation, as described in M2, and a detailed quantitative
		phenotyping, is conducted in M3 generation.<BR>
		The detailed phenotyping is conducted in the field for analyzing morphological
		variation as well as yield-associated traits.<BR><BR>

		We built a detailed phenotypic catalog with 15 major categories and 48 sub categories.
