<p>
From single lines that segregate for a mutant phenotype seeds are extracted separately<BR>
from two mutant plants.

<P>From lines that show segregation for two mutations (where there are 2 independent<BR>
plants for each of the mutations) seeds are extracted from 2 plants for each phenotype<BR>
(total 4)

<p>From single mutant lines where there is a single plant showing a mutant phenotype<BR>
seeds are extracted from it and from a bulk of the normal sibs.

<P>From single lines that segregate for sterility seeds are extracted from the bulk<BR>
(1 fruit per plant).
<P>From lines with more than 2 mutations seed will be extracted individually from all plants.
