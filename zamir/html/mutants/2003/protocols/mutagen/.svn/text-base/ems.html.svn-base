<P>Seeds of M82 were treated with ethyl metanesulfonate (0.5 percent EMS for 12 h; LD15)<BR>
causing primarily C/G to T/A transitions

<u>EMS mutagenesis protocol (tomato seeds)</u><BR>
<BR>
Imbide seeds on wet Whatman paper (8-10 hrs)<BR>
Transfer seeds to an Erlenmeyer bottle containing dH2O (100ml for 10,000 seeds)<BR>
Add 0.5% EMS solution<BR>
Mix and incubate for 12 hrs with gentle shaking in hood at room temperature<BR>
Remove the EMS (put EMS solution into 1M NaOH overnight,<BR>
then dispose as regular waste.<BR>
Also wash all dishes and pipettes with NaOH)<BR>
Rinse the seeds extensively under running water for 5-10 minutes<BR>
Dry the seeds in incubator<BR>
Sow the seeds, preferably on the same day<BR>
<BR><BR>
Calibration of EMS concentration: (all treatments were given for 12hours)<BR>
	<blockquote>
	0.5% EMS = LD15<BR>
	0.7% = LD25<BR>
	0.9% = LD70<BR>
	1%= LD90<BR>
