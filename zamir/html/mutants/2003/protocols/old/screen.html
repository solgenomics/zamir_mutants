Phenotyping is the rate-limiting step in such large-scale mutagenesis studies.<BR> 
Our approach is to develop a stepwise protocol for extensive phenotypic analysis<BR>
aimed at capturing data and images describing the entire life cycle of the plants.<BR>
The first phenotypic screen is conducted in M2 generation and is based on visual<BR> 
characterization of the plants at all developmental stages from the nursery until<BR>
fruit maturation in the field. We use the <A HREF="http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/MonogenicStocks99.txt" TARGET="_blanc">TGC phenotypic classes</A><BR> 
It should be noted that this screen in family structure allows to isolate not only<BR> 
variation of major effects but also minor 'QTL like' mutations. 
<BR>
<BR>
Verification of a monogenic mutation, as described in M2, and a detailed quantitative<BR> 
phenotyping will be conducted in M3 generation.<BR>
The detailed phenotyping will be conducted in the field for analyzing morphological<BR> 
variation as well as yield-associated traits.<BR><BR>
