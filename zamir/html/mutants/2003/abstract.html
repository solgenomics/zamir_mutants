A comprehensive mutant population is a basic resource for exploring gene function.
We developed an isogenic tomato 'mutation library' in the genetic background of the
inbred variety <a href= "population/m82.html">M82</a>. A total of <a href= "protocols/seeds.html">
13,000 M2 families</a>, derived from <a href= "protocols/mutagen/ems.html">EMS</a> and 
<a href= "protocols/mutagen/fn.html">fast-neutron</a> mutagenesis, were visually phenotyped in the field 
and categorized into a <a href= "protocols/screen.html#catalog">morphological 
catalogue</a> that includes 15 primary and 48 secondary categories. Currently, 3,417 mutations
have been catalogued; among them are most of the previously described phenotypes from the
monogenic mutant collection of <a href="http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/" TARGET="_blanc">The Tomato Genetics Resource Center,</a> 
and over a thousand new mutants, with multiple alleles per locus. The phenotypic database indicates
that most mutations fall into more than a single category (pleiotropic), with some organs such as 
leaves more prone to alterations than others. All data and images can be 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/mutation_site/mutant03_search.cgi">
searched and accessed</a> in the Solanaceae Genome Network on a site called

M2 generation seed were collected from single M1 plants, for constructing
a <A HREF="population/family.html">family design,<br>
</A> and in a <A HREF="population/bulk.html">bulk,</A> for keeping a mutant seed stock available for large scale screening.<BR>
In the summers of 2001, 2002, and 2003 about 6000 M2 generation EMS families  and 7000 Fast-neutron families
(12 plants each) were planted in a commercial field and <A HREF="protocols/screen.html">screened</A> for phenotypic mutations.<BR>
Each mutant was characterized according to a <a href ="protocols/screen.html#catalog">phenotypic catalog</a>.<BR>
<BR><br>
The collection of about 3500 monogenic mutants is amenable for
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/mutation_site/mutant03_search.cgi">searching</A>
according to a detailed phenotypic catalog and combinations of traits.<br>
